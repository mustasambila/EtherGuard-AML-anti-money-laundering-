Project Title:
Tracking fake charitie funds with the help of blockchain
Project Description:
Money laundering poses a significant threat to global financial systems, enabling the concealment of illicit funds and undermining economic stability. Traditional Anti-Money Laundering (AML) methods often struggle with issues related to transparency, traceability, and efficiency. This project explores the integration of blockchain technology to develop a robust system for tracking and preventing money laundering activities. By leveraging blockchain's decentralized, immutable, and transparent nature, the proposed solution aims to enhance the detection, monitoring, and reporting of suspicious transactions, thereby strengthening AML frameworks. The project involves designing a blockchain-based framework, developing smart contracts for automated compliance, and evaluating the system's effectiveness compared to traditional AML methods. The results indicate significant improvements in transaction transparency, traceability, and operational efficiency, demonstrating blockchain's potential in combating financial crimes.
Relevance to Degree Program:
 It will help us in digital forensic of money laundering frauds and corruption and black money.
Proposed Methodology:
Research Design:
•	Qualitative and quantitative approaches to assess the effectiveness of blockchain in AML
Architecture:
•	Decentralized ledger for recording transactions.
•	Integration with existing financial systems and databases.
Components:
•	Identity Verification Module: Utilizing decentralized identity solutions for KYC compliance.
•	Transaction Monitoring Module: Real-time tracking and flagging of suspicious activities.
•	Smart Contracts: Automating reporting and compliance tasks.
Data Collection:
•	Simulated transaction data to test the system.
•	Potential collaboration with financial institutions for real-world data (if feasible).
Analysis:
•	Evaluating the system's ability to detect and prevent money laundering activities.
•	Performance metrics: transaction speed, accuracy of detection, scalability.

Expected Outcomes:
Functional Prototype:
•	A blockchain-based AML tracking system capable of recording, monitoring, and reporting transactions.
Enhanced Transparency and Traceability:
•	Real-time visibility into transaction flows, making it easier to identify suspicious activities.
Performance Evaluation:
•	Comparative analysis demonstrating improvements over traditional AML systems in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and scalability.
